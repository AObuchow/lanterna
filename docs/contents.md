Lanterna 3 Documentation
---

### Overview
Lanterna 3 is a large, and probably final, update to the Lanterna library.
Many parts have been completely rewritten and the parts not rewritten have been touched in at least some way.
The reason for this major overhaul is to finally get it 'right' and fix up all of those API mistakes that have been highlighted
over the years, since lanterna was first published.
