Layout Managers
---

Absolute Layout
---
A Layout manager that places components where they are manually specified to be and sizes them to the size they are  manually assigned to. When using the AbsoluteLayout, please use `setPosition()` and `setSize()` manually on each component to choose where to place them.


Linear Layout
---
A simple layout manager the puts all components on a single line.


Border Layout
---
Imitates the BorderLayout class from AWT, allowing you to add a center component with optional components around it in top, bottom, left and right locations. The edge components will be sized at their preferred size and the center component will take up whatever remains.


Grid Layout
---
This emulates the behaviour of the GridLayout in SWT (as opposed to the one in AWT/Swing).
